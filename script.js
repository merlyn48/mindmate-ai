   MindMate AI — Chatbot Engine  v4.0
   Grounded in Eysenck & Wilson (1976) — A Textbook of Human Psychology

   Key principles applied:
   - Lazarus (1968) Appraisal Theory: stress is shaped by how the
     individual appraises a situation as threatening AND whether they
     feel able to cope. Never assume the source — always ask first.
   - Rogers (1957) Counselling Conditions: empathy, unconditional
     positive regard, and genuineness in every response.
   - Eysenck's neuroticism/arousal model: emotional instability is
     on a spectrum; responses acknowledge individual differences.
   - Martin (Emotions chapter): overt behaviour, physiological signals,
     and subjective experience are all valid — validate all three.
   - Shapiro (Counselling chapter): cognitive clarification of the
     client's problem before offering strategies.
